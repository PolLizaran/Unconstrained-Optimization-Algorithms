# Unconstrained-Optimization-Algorithms

This repo contains some of the algorithms studied during the Mathematical Optimization subject. 

Every Matlab file whose name is in upper cases, cointains a different Unconstrained Optimization Algorithm or a piece of code that is part of a Method.

Some of the algorithms uploaded use First Derivative Methods and others use Second Derivative Methods.

## Algorithms: 

- Gradient Method (GM)
- Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM)
- Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno Method (BFGS)
- Newton Methods (NM)
- Modified Newton Methods with Singular Value Decomposition (MNM-SD)
- Modified Newton Methods with Cholesky Factorization (MNM-CMI)
